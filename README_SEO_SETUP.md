## ❓ Quick FAQs

**Q: Is the sitemap being used automatically?**
A: Yes! Once you submit it to Google, they'll crawl it. No additional setup needed.

**Q: Will this improve my rankings immediately?**
A: Not immediately, but it helps Google find and index your pages faster, which eventually helps rankings.

**Q: What if I make changes to a page?**
A: Just update the `<lastmod>` date in the sitemap. Google will notice and re-crawl it.

**Q: Is robots.txt working?**
A: Yes. It's automatically served from `/public/robots.txt` and blocks API endpoints while allowing your main content.

**Q: Do I need to resubmit the sitemap if I add pages?**
A: No. Google crawls the sitemap regularly. Just add new URLs to it.
