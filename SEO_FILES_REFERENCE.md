## ❓ Quick Answers

### Q: Do I need to manually update the sitemap?
**A:** Yes, when you add new blog posts or case studies. Add the URL entry, update `<lastmod>` date, and ensure it's live.

### Q: Will the sitemap affect my site's performance?
**A:** No. Static files served from `/public` have zero performance impact.

### Q: What if I delete a page?
**A:** Remove the URL entry from sitemap.xml. Google will eventually discover the 404 and remove it from index.

### Q: How long until I see results?
**A:** Indexation: 2-4 weeks. Rankings: 2-3 months (depends on competition).

### Q: Should I change priorities?
**A:** Rarely. Current priorities are optimal. Only change if your site structure changes significantly.
