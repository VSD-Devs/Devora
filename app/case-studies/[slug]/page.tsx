      "We built a technical, portfolio-driven website that showcases HV Direct's capabilities by sector. The design emphasises three market segments, each with dedicated landing pages explaining typical challenges and HV Direct's solutions. A comprehensive project portfolio displays 50+ completed projects with rich case studies: project scope, client type, technical challenges overcome, equipment used, and results (e.g., '15,000V substation upgrade for industrial facility completed 2 weeks ahead of schedule'). Technical specifications and standards compliance (IEC 61936, BS 7909) are highlighted throughout. A 'Services' section details offerings: emergency response, preventive maintenance, installation, upgrades, and compliance testing. An online quote request form captures project details (voltage, scope, timeline, budget) and routes to the appropriate technical team member. A technical blog shares insights on emerging standards, safety best practices, and industry trends, establishing thought leadership. The site also highlights certifications, insurance, and safety record, critical for decision-makers in this space.",

The 'Services' section clearly describes three offerings: (1) Executive 1-on-1 coaching (health assessments, personalized fitness & nutrition plans, accountability), (2) Corporate Wellness Programmes (team assessments, onsite fitness classes, nutrition workshops, wellness challenges), and (3) Workplace Culture Consulting (embedding wellness into company values, ROI analysis, long-term transformation). Each service includes typical outcomes and testimonials. A 'Results' section displays before-and-after metrics from past clients (anonymized) showing health improvements, reduced sick days, productivity gains. An online booking system powered by Calendly lets individuals schedule 1-on-1 consultations or companies request corporate programme consultations.

Instead of unlimited swiping, Slush uses sophisticated matching algorithms analyzing interests, values, and communication style to recommend compatible matches, typically 3-5 per day. Each match suggests a timed video date (15 minutes). Both users receive a push notification; if both accept within 2 hours, the video chat begins. The video interface is intuitive: simple start/end controls, profile visibility during calls to reinforce connection. After video chats, users rate the experience and provide feedback (chemistry, conversation quality, would meet again?). This data improves the matching algorithm. The app includes safety features: video clips aren't recorded, blocked accounts prevent harassment, and reporting mechanisms exist. Users can match by preference: looking for casual dating, relationships, or friendship. Geo-targeting connects nearby singles. Push notifications drive engagement. The backend manages real-time video using WebRTC, matching algorithm optimization, and user data privacy (GDPR compliant).",
