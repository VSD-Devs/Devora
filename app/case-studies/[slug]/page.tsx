Families can explore headstones, plaques, and monuments in real time, swap stone colours, preview inscriptions, and understand scale before requesting a brochure or enquiry.

A technical blog shares insights on emerging standards, safety best practices, and industry trends, establishing thought leadership.

Each match suggests a timed video date (15 minutes). Both users receive a push notification; if both accept within 2 hours, the video chat begins. The video interface is intuitive: simple start/end controls, profile visibility during calls to reinforce connection. After video chats, users rate the experience and provide feedback (chemistry, conversation quality, would meet again?). This data improves the matching algorithm. The app includes safety features: video clips aren't recorded, blocked accounts prevent harassment, and reporting mechanisms exist. Users can match by preference: looking for casual dating, relationships, or friendship. Geo-targeting connects nearby singles. Push notifications drive engagement.
