## 📝 Adding More Case Studies (If Needed)

### Step 1: Add data to the caseStudies object

Edit `app/case-studies/[slug]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
"your-new-slug": {
  title: "Your Company Name",
  subtitle: "Your project tagline",
  challenge: "What was the problem?",
  solution: "How did we solve it?",
  results: {
    "Metric 1": "Value",
    "Metric 2": "Value",
    "Metric 3": "Value",
  },
  services: ["Service 1", "Service 2", "Service 3"],
  technologies: ["Tech 1", "Tech 2", "Tech 3"],
},
```

### Step 2: Add to projects array in OurWork

Edit `components/our-work.tsx` (in the projects array):

```javascript
{
  name: "Your Company Name",
  slug: "your-new-slug",
  description: "Description of the project...",
  image: "/case-studies/your-new-slug.png",
  tags: ["Tag 1", "Tag 2", "Tag 3"],
},
```

### Step 3: Add image

Add your case study image:
```
public/case-studies/your-new-slug.png
```

### Step 4: Build and deploy

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Done! Your new case study will automatically be available at `/case-studies/your-new-slug`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Case study doesn't appear
- Check spelling of slug in both files matches
- Clear `.next` folder and rebuild: `rm -rf .next && npm run build`
- Make sure image exists in `public/case-studies/`

### Link doesn't work
- Verify slug matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check URL structure: `/case-studies/your-slug`
- Make sure you're using Next.js `Link` component, not regular `<a>` tag

### Image not showing
- Verify file is in `public/case-studies/`
- Check filename matches slug (e.g., `envirotech-plumbing.png`)
- Image should be PNG format

### Mobile carousel not working
- Clear browser cache
- Check that Embla carousel library is installed: `npm list embla-carousel-react`
- Test in different browser
