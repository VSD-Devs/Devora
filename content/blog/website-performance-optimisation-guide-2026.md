# Website Performance Optimisation Guide – Boost Speed and Core Web Vitals in 2026

Website performance isn't just about speed – it's about user experience, search rankings, and business growth. In 2026, Google's Core Web Vitals directly impact your search visibility, and studies show that a one-second delay in page load time can reduce conversions by 7%.

At Devora, we've helped startups improve their Core Web Vitals scores by an average of 40%, resulting in higher search rankings and increased organic traffic. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about website performance optimisation, from technical implementation to measurable results.

## Why Website Performance Matters in 2026

Performance optimisation has become a critical ranking factor, not just a nice-to-have feature.

### The Business Impact of Website Speed

**Conversion Rate Statistics:**
- 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load
- A 100ms improvement in load time increases conversion rates by 1%
- Pages that load in under 2 seconds have a 9% higher conversion rate
- Slow-loading sites lose 7% of potential customers for every second of delay

**SEO and Search Rankings:**
- Core Web Vitals are official Google ranking factors
- Fast sites rank higher in mobile search results
- Performance affects bounce rates and user engagement metrics
- Google prioritises user experience signals in ranking algorithms

### Understanding Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals measure three key aspects of user experience:

**1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
- Measures loading performance
- Target: Under 2.5 seconds
- Shows how quickly the main content appears

**2. First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**
- Measures interactivity
- Target: Under 100 milliseconds for FID, under 200ms for INP
- Shows how quickly the page responds to user interactions

**3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
- Measures visual stability
- Target: Under 0.1
- Shows how much content shifts during page load

## Technical Performance Optimisation Strategies

### Image Optimisation Techniques

**Modern Image Formats:**
- Use WebP or AVIF formats for better compression
- Implement responsive images with `srcset` and `sizes`
- Lazy load images below the fold
- Serve appropriately sized images for different devices

**Image Optimisation Checklist:**
```html
<!-- Responsive images with modern formats -->
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600">
</picture>
```

**Best Practices:**
- Compress images before uploading (aim for 70-85% quality)
- Use CDN for image delivery
- Implement image sprites for icons
- Remove unnecessary images and decorative elements

### Code Optimisation and Minification

**JavaScript Optimisation:**
- Minify and compress JavaScript files
- Remove unused code and dependencies
- Use code splitting for large applications
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Eliminate render-blocking scripts

**CSS Optimisation:**
- Minify CSS files
- Remove unused CSS rules
- Use critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- Avoid CSS-in-JS for static sites
- Implement CSS purging tools

**HTML Optimisation:**
- Minify HTML output
- Remove unnecessary whitespace
- Eliminate inline styles where possible
- Use semantic HTML for better parsing

### Caching Strategies

**Browser Caching:**
```javascript
// Cache-Control headers
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

**Server-Side Caching:**
- Implement page caching for static content
- Use object caching for database queries
- Leverage CDN caching for global distribution
- Implement Redis or Memcached for dynamic content

**Service Worker Caching:**
- Cache static assets offline
- Implement stale-while-revalidate strategies
- Use cache-first for immutable resources
- Network-first for dynamic content

### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

**CDN Benefits:**
- Reduced latency through geographic distribution
- Lower server load and bandwidth costs
- Improved reliability and uptime
- Better handling of traffic spikes

**CDN Implementation:**
- Choose a CDN provider (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Vercel Edge)
- Configure caching rules
- Enable compression and minification
- Monitor CDN performance metrics

### Database and Backend Optimisation

**Database Performance:**

## Frontend Performance Optimisation

### Critical Rendering Path Optimisation

**Understanding the Critical Path:**
1. HTML parsing and DOM construction
2. CSS parsing and CSSOM construction
3. Render tree construction
4. Layout calculation
5. Paint and composite

**Optimisation Techniques:**
- Inline critical CSS
- Defer non-critical CSS
- Minimise render-blocking resources
- Use `preload` for critical resources
- Implement resource hints (`preconnect`, `dns-prefetch`)

### JavaScript Loading Strategies

**Async and Defer Attributes:**
```html
<!-- Defer for scripts that need DOM -->
<script defer src="app.js"></script>

<!-- Async for independent scripts -->
<script async src="analytics.js"></script>
```

**Code Splitting:**
- Split code by route (route-based splitting)
- Split code by component (component-based splitting)
- Lazy load components and routes
- Use dynamic imports for large modules

**Tree Shaking:**
- Remove unused code from bundles
- Use ES modules for better tree shaking
- Configure bundlers for optimal tree shaking
- Analyse bundle sizes regularly

### Font Optimisation

**Web Font Best Practices:**
- Use `font-display: swap` for better perceived performance
- Subset fonts to include only needed characters
- Preload critical fonts
- Use system fonts when possible
- Limit the number of font families

**Font Loading Strategy:**
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Custom Font';
  src: url('font.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-display: swap;
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

### Third-Party Script Optimisation

**Managing Third-Party Scripts:**
- Audit all third-party scripts regularly
- Load scripts asynchronously when possible
- Use `rel="preconnect"` for external domains
- Defer non-critical third-party scripts
- Consider self-hosting when feasible

**Common Third-Party Scripts:**
- Analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible)
- Chat widgets (Intercom, Drift)
- Social media embeds
- Advertising scripts
- Video players

## Mobile Performance Optimisation

**Mobile-Specific Optimisations:**
- Optimise for slower mobile networks
- Reduce data usage for mobile users
- Implement touch-friendly interactions
- Test on real mobile devices
- Monitor mobile-specific metrics

**Network-Aware Loading:**
```javascript
// Detect network speed
if ('connection' in navigator) {
  const connection = navigator.connection;
  if (connection.effectiveType === 'slow-2g' || connection.effectiveType === '2g') {
    // Load lighter version
  }
}
```
